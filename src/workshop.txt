title=Coavins Firearm DEVELOPMENT

description=âœ” Works in Multiplayer
description=âœ” Tested on 41.73
description=âœ” Compatible with most other firearm mods 
description=
description=This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, expect things to change.
description=It should be safe to add this mod to an existing save file. Always back up your save.
description=Reassemble your guns before removing this mod or they will disappear forever.

description=[h1]How it works[/h1]
description=[h2]Repairing a firearm[/h2]
description=You won't be able to directly repair firearms anymore. You will instead have to disassemble the gun and either repair or replace the broken parts.
description=
description=Individual components can be repaired using things like duct tape or metalworking. You should expect firearms to degrade at around the same rate as before, and it should take around the same level of effort to repair a gun the first few times that it breaks.
description=
description=Alternatively, just replace the broken part with one taken from a different gun.
description=
description=âš  It will become increasingly more difficult to repair a firearm as more of its parts are broken.
description=
description=[h2]Components[/h2]
description=This mod adds many new items that are used in repair and reassembly. Spare components can be looted from most places where guns are normally found.
description=
description=[url=https://github.com/coavins/zomboid-coavins-firearms/wiki/Models]Check the wiki[/url] for a full list of the different models used to simulate firearm disassembly.
description=
description=â„¹ Some parts can contain other parts, forming a tree structure - all components must be in full working condition before the firearm will operate. If any part is missing or broken, the firearm (if you reassemble it) will be "broken" and will not fire.
description=
description=â„¹ Parts can be swapped between firearms of the same style.
description=
description=[h2]Condition[/h2]
description=This mod completely replaces the existing system that handles condition for firearms.
description=
description=[h3]Vanilla[/h3]
description=A firearm has a chance to lose condition every time you shoot. When this happens, the condition of the gun goes down. The gun can be repaired using another one of the same type of gun.
description=
description=[h3]With this mod[/h3]
description=Firearms retain their original chance to lose condition every time you shoot, but when this happens, we instead check to see if each part inside the gun should lose condition. Different parts lose condition at different rates. The gun itself will display the condition of its most damaged component.
description=
description=[h2]Compatibility with other mods[/h2]
description=This mod should be compatible with most other mods that introduce new firearms or change how they work.
description=
description=Support has to be added manually for every mod. This is a work in progress.
description=

description=
description=If you are a player and you want to disassemble custom firearms, then either:
description=[list][*]use one of the included compatibility patches,
description=[*]ask the other author to include support for this mod,
description=[*]or submit a pull request to add a compatibility patch
description=[/list]
description=If you are a developer and you want to add support for this feature in your mod, refer to my example mod coavinssupport1 which shows how to add compatibility with custom firearms.
description=
description=âš  By default, only vanilla firearms can be disassembled - if a mod is not explicitly supported, its custom firearms will use the normal repair feature and can not be disassembled.
