### Additional Notes

## Creating a Pull Request

Please create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch with a clear explanation of what you've done (read more about pull requests [here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).)

You should create a new branch for each pull request, and rebase/squash it into as few logical commits as possible.

This repository generally follows the [Chris Beams standards](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for commit messages:

    Separate subject from body with a blank line
    Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    Capitalize the subject line
    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    Do not end the subject line with a period
    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    Wrap the body at 72 characters

Your commits will be expected to meet these standards before your PR will be merged.
